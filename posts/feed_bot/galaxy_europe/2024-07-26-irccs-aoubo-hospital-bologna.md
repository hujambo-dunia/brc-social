üìù New blog post Released!

The [Galaxy Project](https://galaxyproject.org/) has found its way into the practices of [IRCCS
Azienda Ospedaliero\-Universitaria di Bologna (IRCCS AOUBO)](https://www.aosp.bo.it), a leading medical institution in
Bologna, Italy.
At IRCCS AOUBO, research groups are wielding the Galaxy Project capabilities and have
integrated it in the [Computational Genomics Platform](https://www.aosp.bo.it/content/genomica-computazionale), a system of bioinformatic solutions
designed and maintained by the IRCCS AOUBO Computational Genomics (BOSCO) team.
Notably, the hospital is using a production Galaxy instance consisting of a customised local
Galaxy server tailored to the execution of genomic analysis workflows in the clinical setting.
BOSCO Galaxy instance is primarily focused on the genomic diagnosis of rare diseases, but
use cases are now expanding to other clinical needs and towards the incorporation of data from
different technologies. In this context, Galaxy is marking an improvement in:


* the development and implementation of custom bioinformatic pipelines,
* data sharing among genomic and clinical scientists within the institute,
* making complex bioinformatic tasks available to non\-bioinformaticians
* providing the clinical research community with maintained, standardised, reproducible


and easy\-to\-use analysis pipelines.
For these reasons, the Galaxy Project has found a stable place in the genomic toolkit that the
BOSCO team has been established at IRCCS AOUBO and represents a favourable ground for
the development and deployment of data analysis pipelines in the clinic.
